The girl was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Torres was charged Oct. 25 with one count of murder, one count of assault on a child causing death and one count of arson, according to a complaint filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Family members told police that Torres may have been  under the influence of methamphetamine, Carmona said. Police said Torres, who underwent surgery for his stab wounds, is being monitored by police as he recovers.The killing stunned residents of the apartment complex. Neighbors walked around the courtyard the next morning and talked in hushed tones as a family set up chairs and tables for another girl’s birthday party.The smell of ash hung in the air, and behind the complex was a pile of scorched belongings, among them a pink bike and a pink chiffon dress. In the courtyard near a statue of the Virgin Mary, a black-and-white photo had been added of a smiling Rosario in a white dress.Geraldine Calvillo, 28, said she had just seen the child playing in the courtyard Thursday night. Calvillo said the killing is upsetting. Her daughter, whom the birthday party was being held for, is the same age as Rosario.Alyson Aspe, Velazquez’s granddaughter, who also lives next door to the family, said she was at school Thursday when her grandfather called her with the news. Velazquez, along with the child’s cousin, rushed back to the apartment but couldn’t get past the police tape.“I was shocked,” she said. “I just carried the baby the day before.”Aspe said that the family was generally quiet, but the mother and father “would fight a lot.” Rosario, she said, was a shy, serious baby who warmed up only to people she knew well. Aspe, who has lived at the complex for about six years, said that the area is normally safe. She said sometimes, gang members hang out in the alley, but nothing like this has happened. Carmona said the case is tragic.“It affects officers; it affects everybody,” he said.Calvillo said that when she last saw the child, the girl had fallen off her bike and had started to cry. Her father was nearby, comforting her. He told her everything would be OK.Contact the Homicide Report.

Jennabel was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 7, according to coroner’s records. Luis Anaya escaped unscathed. During a memorial at the shooting site Sunday, he and others recounted what they heard and saw that evening. Anaya told The Times he didn’t recognize the man, whose face was “all covered up.” The two had only briefly locked eyes by the time Anaya saw the gun.""I couldn't make his face,"" he said. ""When I tried to look at him, he shot at me.""As mother and daughter lay bleeding in the street, Anaya screamed so loudly that neighbor Robert Navarro said he thought the couple was having an argument. Navarro ran out of his home and into the intersection, where he found Anaya desperately trying to comfort his mortally wounded girlfriend and daughter.“The baby … she still had her eyes open,” Navarro said. “He was trying to comfort her by calling the grandmother and the grandmother spoke to the baby on the phone.”Twelve hours later, the little girl’s grandmother was standing in the same intersection, screaming out in Spanish and English, asking over and over why her daughter and granddaughter were dead.The shooter fled on foot, heading east. Investigators had yet to determine a motive or identify a suspect in the slaying, leaving neighbors to wonder why anyone would open fire on a young woman and her child.“How are you gonna see a family walking and go crazy?” asked Gabriel Sanchez, 26, a longtime friend of Mancera. “Why would you shoot a child? The child is just living life, innocent.”As far as their friends knew, Anaya and Mancera didn’t have any enemies. Anaya works in construction, and friends said the couple weren’t involved gangs. The two grew up in Long Beach, friends said, and began dating roughly five years ago.Sanchez remembered Mancera as a mischievous and friendly presence when they met at Long Beach’s Washington Middle School more than a decade ago. “She was a real cool girl. No drama with anybody,” she said. “She didn’t have problems with anybody for someone to do this to her and her daughter.” Anaya and Mancera lived in an apartment on Locust Avenue , a brief walk from the intersection where the shooting took place. The couple’s next-door neighbor, 38-year-old Matt Milewski said he heard four gunshots in total -- an initial blast, then three shots in quick succession.Milewski said gunshots and violence are rare in the neighborhood, which sits less than two miles from the waterfront and just outside Long Beach’s downtown area.At least two dozen people spent several hours Sunday crowded around the small memorial at the site of the shooting, placing votive candles and flowers at the base of the stop sign where Mancera and her daughter were killed. A pastor arrived to lead the group in a prayer, and several people made repeated and futile attempts to console Mancera’s mother, who covered her mouth and nearly fell to the ground as she approached the intersection.Juan Jimenez, a longtime friend of Anaya, said the two had been working construction jobs together in recent years. He couldn’t explain why anyone would want to hurt his friend's family, and said Anaya often talked about how safe their neighborhood was.“We were talking about this area and he was like, ‘It’s cool. Nobody messes with me,’” Jimenez said.Navarro said Jennabel was looking forward to September, when she was supposed to start her first year in school. “She got a backpack and she was very happy for the backpack. And then this happens,” Navarro said, tearing up. “So she won’t be making it to school.”Homicide Sgt. Woods dismissed notions that the shooting was linked to gang activity and expressed disappointment that police tip lines had not been flooded with calls.“I was a little disheartened by that,” he said. “I thought we would just have an influx of information coming from the public. We haven’t had it yet.”Woods would not comment on the type of weapon used. “I will say it was at close range and very brutal,” he said.Police have recovered surveillance footage, but Woods said that alone “is not going to solve our case” and urged more witnesses to come forward. Though the number of homicides in Long Beach has not increased significantly this year, violent crime across the city jumped by 8% in the first six months of 2016. Mayor Robert Garcia cautioned that crime in the city was still down dramatically over the last decade, and he attributed the recent surge in Long Beach to a larger statewide trend.“We know that violent crime has been increasing in most California cities, especially the larger ones, and so we’re looking at that,” he said. “We’re putting more resources to ensure the community is safe.”Anyone with information should call Long Beach homicide Dets.

The mother’s death was ruled a suicide,  Vega’s a homicide. Investigators don’t know what prompted Ibarra to kill herself and her child, Corina said. The mother “was having some kind of issues and a little bit of a drug problem, but we’re not really sure why she felt she had to take her child with her,” Corina said. “Anytime someone takes their own life, you know there’s some suffering, but to take your child’s life ... it’s horrible.” Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff’s Department Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500.

Mark Mattia said.All three adults were hospitalized but survived the shootings. The next day, a man searching for cans to recycle in Imperial Beach found the infant’s body in a commercial dumpster in the 600 block of Palm Avenue, about 120 miles south of where she was abducted, according to the San Diego County coroner’s report. Eliza was pronounced dead at the scene at 1:40 p.m., according to coroner’s records. The autopsy report indicated she died of asphyxiation but didn’t provide further details, including how or where she was killed, Mattia said. The man found Eliza’s body when he tore open a white, kitchen-sized plastic bag inside the dumpster, according to the coroner’s report. She was wearing a pink-and-white-striped onesie and a single white sock with pink trim on her right foot, according to the coroner’s notes. The coroner’s office reported no evidence of trauma to Eliza’s body, except for several red, petechial hemorrhages — a rash of broken blood vessels that often accompany asphyxiation — on her face. “It’s a very, very, very sad case,” Mattia said. “I don’t know what else to say but that. In this job, you deal with death all the time, but when a child is involved, it’s just different.”Investigators arrested four people on March 25, 2015, after a man attacked a 23-year-old woman with a baseball bat and tried to kidnap her 4-month-old son in an El Segundo motel on Feb. 6, 2015. Anthony Ray McCall, 29, of Oceanside, ran away when motel employees knocked on the woman’s door, according to KTLA 5. Authorities later linked him to the kidnapping and shootings in Long Beach. In a news conference after the arrest, investigators said McCall was part of a bizarre plot to steal an infant for his accomplice and co-conspirator, Giseleangelique Rene D’Milian, 47, of Thousand Oaks, The Times reported. D’Milian devised a plot to kidnap two babies, investigators said, because she needed to convince her married boyfriend that she had delivered twins while he was overseas.According to investigators, D’Milian targeted children to possibly abduct by claiming to have a charity that assisted their mothers. On the day of Eliza’s kidnapping, D’Milian trailed the baby and her mother, Jackie Honorato, as they rode a Long Beach bus.When Honorato got off the bus carrying her baby, D’Milian pulled alongside them in her dark-colored Range Rover and offered them a lift home. Honorato declined the ride, but didn’t suspect “something was going to happen” later, The Times reported.The Long Beach Press-Telegram reported that during a preliminary hearing in October 2016, Honorato testified that she and her husband were watching television upstairs in the house they shared with her brother-in-law when they heard a commotion downstairs.The brother-in-law, Jose De La Cruz, testified that McCall burst into his house and shot him before storming up the stairs.When the gunman approached Honorato, he said, “ ‘Give me the baby,’ ” the woman testified, and then shot her when she refused. “He literally took your baby out of your arms?” prosecutor Cynthia Barnes asked. “Yes,” Honorato replied.After she fell, Honorato said she heard the gunman walk downstairs and a female voice from below that she recognized as the woman who had offered her a ride earlier in the day.“The voice said, ‘I’m your new mommy,’ ” Honorato said. “That was the last thing I heard,” the Press-Telegram reported. D’Milian pleaded no contest in January 2018 to one count of first-degree murder in Eliza’s death and two counts of attempted murder for trying to kill the infant’s father and uncle, according to a news release from the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office. She was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. On March 2, a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury found McCall guilty of first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted kidnapping and four counts of attempted murder. The jury also found all of the allegations true in the case, including gun use and infliction of great bodily harm. McCall was sentenced on March 19 to five life sentences, as well as 141 years and eight months in prison, according to the release. D’Milian’s daughter, Charisse Shelton, 30, of Corona, and Todd Damon Boudreaux, 44, of Fontana, also were arrested in March 2015 on suspicion of being an accessory to the crime after the fact.Shelton later was released and never was charged, Mattia said, but Boudreaux pleaded guilty to one count of accessory after the fact in October 2016 and was sentenced to three years in prison on March 19.  Photo: Patches Pelts of Long Beach lights a candle at a vigil to mourn the death of 3-week-old Eliza De La Cruz on Jan. 9, 2015.

When they arrived at the home, the officers found Maldonado bruised and unresponsive, according to the release. Maldonado was pronounced dead at a local hospital at 6:26 a.m., according to Los Angeles County coroner records. The toddler had bruising “all over his body,” including his hairline, face, ears, abdomen, chest, arms and legs, according to a petition filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court to remove the surviving sibling from his mother’s custody. The Sheriff's Department Homicide Bureau took over the investigation at the request of Signal Hill police. Investigators spent nearly a year examining the evidence, according to the district attorney's office. The coroner's office didn't rule the boy's death a homicide until recently, said sheriff's Lt. Steve Jauch.In the year before the boy died, The Times learned, his mother had twice been reported to authorities for putting her children's welfare in jeopardy. In each case, the children were left in her custody.Maldonado’s mother, Jessica Rey Cereceres, and her boyfriend, Samuel Aguilar, were charged Monday with abusing both of her children. The youngest child, a 1-year-old boy, was taken into protective custody and put into foster care after his brother died, Jauch said. The boyfriend, Aguilar, a 23-year-old Latino, was also charged with one count of murder, assault on a child causing death and injuring a girlfriend, according to a news release from the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office. Aguilar's arraignment is scheduled for Aug. 27 in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Long Beach. He is being held in lieu of $1.3 million bail. Jauch confirmed that Aguilar has been in jail since December 2014, when he was arrested on suspicion of witness intimidation and dissuasion. Jauch refused to elaborate, except to say the arrest was related to the child abuse investigation. Maldonado’s mother, Cereceres, a 24-year-old Latina, was charged Tuesday with two counts of child abuse. Her arraignment is also set for Aug. 27 at Los Angeles County Superior Court in Long Beach, according to the district attorney's news release. Her bail has been set at $200,000. Cereceres has been cooperating with investigators, according to the Sheriff's Department.Jauch said the investigation is ongoing.

A cause of death has since been deferred pending additional laboratory tests. Results will not be available for at least six to eight weeks, officials said.

A cause of death has since been deferred pending additional laboratory tests. Results will not be available for at least six to eight weeks, officials said.

Aaron, who attended elementary school in Compton, was going to a Halloween party in Inglewood, said his grandfather.""I saw one of the men move to position himself to get a clear shot off, and he pointed a weapon and pulled the trigger,"" he said. ""I turned around and I got shot in the left wrist, and he continued to fire as we were running.""""This is absolutely horrific. This is 2 p.m. on Halloween,"" said LAPD Deputy Chief Pat Gannon, who oversees South Los Angeles' policing. ""This little boy was getting ready to go trick-or-treating.""There is no reason for this shooting,"" he said. ""This family has no gang ties. The shooters ... they are nothing but cowards.""Several days after the incident, two suspected gang members were arrested in connection with Aaron's death. Marcus Denson, an 18-year-old black man, and Leonard Hall Jr., a 21-year old black man, are each being held on $1-million bail after they were apprehended by Los Angeles police detectives. Investigators said they believe the alleged gunmen had mistaken the location for one they intended to fire on.Denson was taken into custody on Nov. 4, while Hall was arrested early Friday morning. Both are considered to be members of the Kitchen Crips gang; a rival gang controls the neighborhood where Aaron was killed.Hall is on parole after a conviction on a charge of possession of a controlled substance, officials said. Jail records show he was also arrested on Oct. 15, but details about that arrest were not immediately available. As part of the conditions of his parole, he is forbidden from associating with the Kitchen Crips, according to a law enforcement source.-- Richard WintonDo you have information to share about the life of                     Aaron Shannon Jr.                    ?

She died Nov. 22, allegedly at the hands of her stepfather, a convicted batterer with whom the mother had left the baby, according to court records and a confidential child-fatality report obtained by The Times.Her death comes amid growing public scrutiny of suspected abuse and neglect fatalities among children whose families at some point were under the supervision of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services.There were 14 such deaths in 2008 and at least that many this year, though some remain under investigation, according to department officials and records recently made public under California law.Diamond's death is being investigated by the department, Santa Monica police and the L.A. County coroner's office.Many of those deaths occurred after children left the department's watch -- to return to their families after a stint in foster care or to enter the criminal justice system, records show.But Diamond's case calls the department's vigilance into greater question, because she was still under its direct supervision when she was killed.Donald Renald Hillman Jr., 33, a resident of Santa Monica and her mother's estranged husband, has pleaded not guilty to murder and child abuse.He is being held in lieu of $1-million bail.Do you have information to share about the life of                     Diamond Hillman                    ?

The victim in critical condition is expected to lose her leg, authorities said. Police officials said the motorist sped off after driving into the crowd, but that she later showed up with her mother at the 77th Street station and was being questioned there by homicide detectives Monday night.    The brawl was part of a planned showdown between two groups of women in their early 20s, according to LAPD Cmdr. Pat Gannon. The cause of the dispute was unclear, he said.    The fight began shortly after 2:30 p.m. at a Big Lots discount store parking lot, where witnesses saw women shouting at one another and fighting, Gannon said. The brawl then spilled onto the street and across Western to a nearby 76 gas station.    At the gas station, the driver of the convertible got into her car and drove into a group of women, pinning one of them against another car, Gannon said. Meanwhile, a crowd of dozens gathered.

The man is listed in stable condition with gunshot wounds to the chest.A $75,000 reward was offered for information leading to an arrest in this case--$25,000 more than is usually offered. The case also was immediately assigned to LAPD's elite Robbery-Homicide Division and drew widespread media attention. It's worth noting, however, that homicides in LAPD's Rampart division have been down by 33% this year. With just 15 homicides this year, the precinct ranks about ninth among the city's 19 precincts in killings. LAPD's Newton and 77th Street precincts to the south have each had nearly three times as many murders this year as Rampart, with 41 apiece.Also worth noting is that 14 robbery-homicide detectives were sent to investigate this one case. The other 14 people killed in Rampart division this year continue to have their cases investigated by Rampart's normal cadre of precinct detectives--that is, six detectives, total.Update: Police announced Tuesday that 19-year-old Luis Silva had been arrested and charged in connection to this killing.Photo: Pallbearers Rev.

On Jan. 19, detectives arrested Charles Edward Davis Jr., a 32-year-old black man, on suspicion of murder, police said. Davis has been charged with murder and assault on a child causing death, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office.

Detectives believe that Davis is an “acquaintance” of the child’s mother.

Do you have information to share about the life of Franklin Senkarana Pon-Ros? The Homicide Report needs your help. Please fill out this form.","Franklin Pon-Ros, a 3-year-old boy of Cambodian-Laotian descent, died on Saturday, Jan. 20, after he was shot in the 2800 block of West Alondra Boulevard in Compton, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records. Franklin was in the back seat of a car when his mother and her boyfriend stopped in the parking lot of Nate’s Liquor Mart at West Alondra Boulevard and South McKinley Avenue about 7:40 p.m., said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Lt. Joe Mendoza. The boyfriend walked into the store briefly, passing another man standing at the counter, according to surveillance video made public on KTLA5 and other networks this week. The men saw each other but did not speak in the store, Mendoza said. The man at the counter left and walked to his car, which was parked near the door. The boyfriend left the store a few minutes later, and as he walked by the other man’s car, the two apparently had a brief verbal exchange, Mendoza said, “and that’s when the shooting begins.”Investigators say both men exchanged gunfire. The surveillance video shows the boyfriend standing behind a white sedan and raising his arm to shoot. The other man, who was sitting behind the wheel of his car with the door open, twisted around in his seat to fire back toward the sedan, where Franklin sat in the back seat. The boyfriend got into the front passenger seat of the white sedan, which sped away on Alondra Boulevard seconds later, according to the video. “As they drove away, they noticed the child had been shot,” Mendoza said. “They immediately called 911 and came to a stop in a parking lot in the 17200 block of South Central Avenue in Carson, a little over a mile away, to wait for law enforcement. Compton Station deputies responded and took the child to the hospital themselves in an attempt to save his life.”Franklin was pronounced dead at the hospital at 8:02 p.m., according to coroner records. His paternal aunt, Sovannary Ros, said her family found out about the shooting through the media, and has been reeling ever since. An online fundraiser has been established to help the family with expenses. “Franklin was such a happy person,” Ros said in an interview on Jan. 23. “He loved his family, he loved playing with his cousins. He’d loved giving hugs and he’d say ‘Hi’ to anybody. He was just a loving kid.”The night Franklin died, investigators questioned the boyfriend, who has not been publicly identified. The boyfriend was cooperative, Mendoza said, and not arrested. In the meantime, “based on physical evidence, witness statements and the video, investigators were able to identify the other male who was involved in shooting the child,” he said.Investigators contacted the man’s family and his attorney, Mendoza said, and arranged for his surrender on Monday, Jan. 22, at the East Los Angeles sheriff’s station. The man, Dwayne Christopher Ward, 29, is being held in jail for violating the terms of his parole, Mendoza said. No other charges have been filed at this point, he said. “We’re trying to get all the information and be as thorough as possible so the district attorney can evaluate the incident and determine the criminal culpability of the parties involved,” Mendoza said. Community members led by activist Najee Ali held a vigil for Franklin on the weekend, calling for Ward to turn himself in, but after the surveillance video surfaced, Ali and others held another news conference on Tuesday, saying the boyfriend needed to be held accountable.In a separate interview, both Ali and LaWanda Hawkins said the boyfriend should have known better than to pull a gun when a toddler was in his car. “We feel it’s a public safety issue as long as he’s on the street,” said Hawkins,  who started Justice for Murdered Children after her 19-year-old son, Reggie, was killed in San Pedro in 1995. “We’re scared more blood is going be spilled while he’s on the street. Everyone involved with that shooting needs to be arrested.”Franklin’s father, Richard Ros of San Diego, echoed those sentiments on Wednesday, Jan. 24, when he came to Los Angeles to work out burial arrangements and ”seek justice for my son,” he said. He called on investigators to arrest the boyfriend. “They should be putting him behind bars because he’s the one who provoked the shooting,” Ros said. ""I lost the love of my life. He’s gone now, and no one can give him back to me.”Mendoza said there are currently no plans to arrest the boyfriend, and he wouldn’t confirm who fired the first shots. “If you can clearly see what happened in the video, that’s fine, but we’re trying to protect the investigation from being tainted,” Mendoza said. “The bottom line is that both of them shouldn’t have had guns, but right now, we’re just trying to get to the truth as best as possible. The boyfriend is not wanted at this point. It’s up to the DA to decide who will be charged.”Anyone with information is asked to call the sheriff’s Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500.
